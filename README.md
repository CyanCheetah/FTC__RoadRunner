# FTC_rr_1.5.2023
FTC RoadRunner

This is the First Tech Challenge Road Runner code files required for the RoadRunner quickstart by Gluten Free. This repository includes the Drive Constants, the StraightTest (Though it isnt the test it actually is the path for the robot though I was just too lazy to rename it) and it also includes many more code files required to make rr operational).
